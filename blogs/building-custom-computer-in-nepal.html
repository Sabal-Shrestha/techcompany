          <h3>Define your needs</h3>
          <p>
            Before you start building your custom computer, you need to decide
            what you need it for. Will you be using it for gaming, video
            editing, or programming? Your usage will dictate the type of
            components you need, such as the CPU, GPU, RAM, and storage.
          </p>
          <h3>Select your components</h3>
          <p>
            Once you know what you need, it's time to select your components.
            You can purchase components from local stores or order them online.
            Be sure to compare prices from different sellers to get the best
            deals. Also, make sure to check the warranty and return policies for
            each component.
          </p>
          <h3>Build your computer</h3>
          <p>
            After you have gathered all the components, it's time to put them
            together. You can either do it yourself or hire a professional to do
            it for you. If you're doing it yourself, make sure to follow the
            instructions carefully and take your time. Be patient and
            double-check everything as you go along.
          </p>
          <h3>Install the operating system</h3>
          <p>
            Once you have assembled your computer, it's time to install an
            operating system. You can use Windows, Linux, or any other operating
            system of your choice. Make sure you have a valid license key for
            the operating system you choose.
          </p>
          <h3>Test your computer</h3>
          <p>
            After you have installed the operating system, it's time to test
            your computer. Run benchmark tests to see if your system is
            performing as expected. Also, check if all components are working
            correctly, including the CPU, GPU, RAM, and storage.
          </p>
          <p>
            In conclusion, building a custom computer can be a fun and rewarding
            experience, especially in Nepal, where the local market offers a
            variety of components at competitive prices. By defining your needs,
            selecting the right components, building your computer carefully,
            installing the operating system, and testing your system, you can
            create a custom computer that meets all your requirements. With the
            right components and a bit of patience, you can create a powerful
            system that will provide you with years of reliable performance.
